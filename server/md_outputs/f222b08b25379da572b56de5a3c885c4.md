# TENDER FOR PROCUREMENT OF DATA LAYER SOLUTION FOR NEXT GENERATION PASSENGER RESERVATION SYSTEM (PRS) OF INDIAN RAILWAYS

## Components of Next Generation Passenger Reservation System

### 22.1. Physical Servers

The next generation PRS is deployed using x86 based commodity servers, classified as:

- Management Nodes
- Compute nodes for Application workload

### 22.2.1. Management Nodes

The Management nodes will be used for the deployment of management components of various software products and their portals. These components need to be configured in high availability with active-active mode. Indicative management components to be deployed on these nodes include:

1. Infrastructure Services
- DHCP servers
- NTP servers (should be deployed in bare-metal servers)
- DNS servers
- HTTP Proxy servers
- Air gaped mirror instances
2. Kubernetes Master Nodes along with etcd
3. Kubernetes monitoring related components (e.g., Prometheus, Thanos, etc.)
4. Kubernetes Dashboard
5. Kubernetes RBAC manager related components
6. Cluster Log shipping related components (e.g., Fluentd, etc.)
7. Cluster Auto scalers to scale Kubernetes cluster nodes up and down
8. Hardware Load-Balancer Orchestrator related components for load balancing of Kubernetes service
9. Virtualization Management, Automation, Monitoring and its Components
10. Virtualization SDN Management, Automation, Monitoring and its Components
11. Container Platform Management, Automation, Monitoring and its Components
12. Container Platform SDN Management, Automation, Monitoring and its Components
13. Container Image Registry and its components
15. SAN Storage Management and its Components
16. LDAP and Identity and Access Management and its Components
17. Help Desk Management and its Components
18. Backup Management and its Components
19. Any Kind of Operations Management and its Components
20. Any other Management related Components

All logs will be preserved for 180 days for Network and Security equipment, and for all other hardware and software, logs shall be kept for 1 year.

### 22.2.2. Compute Nodes for Application Workload

(Details for this section are not provided in the current text.)

# TENDER FOR PROCUREMENT OF DATA LAYER SOLUTION FOR NEXT GENERATION PASSENGER RESERVATION SYSTEM (PRS) OF INDIAN RAILWAYS

## Compute Nodes
The Compute nodes will be used for running the application. These Nodes can be categorized as:
- Kubernetes Worker Nodes
- Transaction Database Nodes

### Kubernetes Worker Nodes
These compute nodes will be part of the Kubernetes cluster and will act as worker nodes. On these servers, various micro-service applications will be deployed with their multiple layers like:
- Data layer (IMDG and Static DB)
- Business layer
- Service layer
- Presentation layer

These servers would be high compute capable, as application workload would be running on these servers.

### Transaction Database Nodes
These compute nodes will be used to deploy the NoSQL Database used for online transaction processing purposes.

## SAN Storage
The SAN Storage will be used as the Storage layer, and all the application data, logs, and monitoring data will be stored on this layer. For high performance, a set of NVMe disk pools will also be configured in this layer. Additionally, SAN storage will be used for storing data for analytics purposes. SAN storage needs to provide volumes to Bare-Metal, VMs, and Kubernetes workloads.

The SAN storage should have the capability to provide:
- Raw partition
- Shared partition
- LUN to Bare-Metal servers and VMs

## Container Platform
The next generation PRS will use Kubernetes as a Container platform, which will provide a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. Kubernetes will provide capabilities like:
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Storage orchestration
- Automated rollouts and rollbacks
- Automatic bin packing
- Self-healing
- Secret and configuration management

Multiple micro-services mapped to various business services will be deployed as containers on this setup and will scale out as per the application load. To handle the peak load, the Kubernetes setup will burst to cloud (on-prem and public) on a need basis. The Kubernetes setup with the capability of deploying across multiple Datacentres will provide the benefits of a Disaster Recovery Site.

# TENDER FOR PROCUREMENT OF DATA LAYER SOLUTION FOR NEXT GENERATION PASSENGER RESERVATION SYSTEM (PRS) OF INDIAN RAILWAYS

## 22.4. Service Mesh

A service mesh is a configurable, low-latency infrastructure layer designed to handle a high volume of network-based inter-process communication among application infrastructure services using application programming interfaces (APIs). A service mesh ensures that communication among containerized and often ephemeral application infrastructure services is fast, reliable, and secure.

Service mesh reduces the complexity associated with a microservice architecture and provides functionalities like:

- Load Balancing
- Service discovery
- Health checks
- Authentication
- Traffic management and routing
- Circuit breaking and failover policy
- Security
- Metrics and telemetry
- Fault injection

# TENDER FOR PROCUREMENT OF DATA LAYER SOLUTION FOR NEXT GENERATION PASSENGER RESERVATION SYSTEM (PRS) OF INDIAN RAILWAYS

## 22.5. Application Service Gateway

The services of Next Generation PRS deployed over Kubernetes will be accessed by multiple client applications. These client applications can be primarily classified as:

### Internal Client Applications
These applications are deployed within the CRIS datacentre but outside the Kubernetes cluster. They will access the services over the CRIS internal network.

- **Counters** – Ticket booking counters located at Railway Premises or Non-Rail Head.
- **NGET** - Next Generation E-Ticketing application is the enhanced internet ticketing website for the rail ticket booking system.
- **Others**:
- i. **PMS** - PNR details, Dog cat booking.
- ii. **NTES/ICMS** - Train cancellation, delay.
- iii. **WECRS** - For TDR refund.
- iv. **HHT** - Web Service for Vacant Berth (Not turned up passenger) Release, FTP of chart files.
- v. **HRMS** - Integration with HRMS for pass booking.
- vi. **GST** - Integration using TIBCO.
- vii. **Retiring Room** - Integration during booking and cancellation, PNR enquiry is given to Retiring room.

### External Client Applications
These are third-party applications deployed outside the CRIS datacentre. They will access the services over the internet.

- **Banks** – CPG (POS, UPI, QR code), NCM card-POS, UPI during booking. Offline refund initiation next day.
- **UIDAI** - Aadhaar validation during user registration.
- **Others**:
- i. **B2B** - Business to Business Agents.
- ii. **B2C** - Business to Consumer Agents (e.g., Make My Trip, Yatra).
- iii. **G2G** - Government to Government (e.g., CGDA, CRPF, BSF).
- iv. **G2C** - Government to Consumer.

Following components will be deployed to provision access to the services to different client applications.

# TENDER FOR PROCUREMENT OF DATA LAYER SOLUTION FOR NEXT GENERATION PASSENGER RESERVATION SYSTEM (PRS) OF INDIAN RAILWAYS

## 22.5.1. Ingress Controller

- In Kubernetes, an Ingress Controller allows access to your Kubernetes services from outside the Kubernetes cluster.
- Configure access by creating a collection of rules that define which inbound connections reach which services.

```
Incoming request

Cluster  Ingress

Service    Service

Pod      Pod        Pod
```

- The internal client application will access the next generation PRS services through Ingress Controller or Hardware Load-balancer.

## 22.5.2. API Gateway

- An API gateway takes all API calls from external clients coming over the internet, then routes them to the appropriate microservice with request routing, composition, and protocol translation.
- It handles a request by invoking multiple microservices and aggregating the results to determine the best path.
- It can translate between web protocols and web-unfriendly protocols that are used internally.
- The API gateway will forward the request to Ingress controller or Hardware Load-balancer for service access.

## 22.5.3. Hardware Load Balancer

- Hardware based Load Balancer will forward all the south bound traffic to the Kubernetes clusters and to any other service provisioned to be load balanced.
- Hardware based Load Balancer should provision load-balancing for Kubernetes service of type “Load Balancer” and should integrate with Container Management Platform for the same.

# TENDER FOR PROCUREMENT OF DATA LAYER SOLUTION FOR NEXT GENERATION PASSENGER RESERVATION SYSTEM (PRS) OF INDIAN RAILWAYS

## 22.6. Data Layer

The data layer of Next Generation PRS will be polyglot and will depend on the requirements of the micro-service. Based on the performance, consistency, and persistency needs, the following components will be present:

### 22.7.1. In-Memory Data Grid

- For services requiring faster data access, IMDG will be used for storing the service data and will be deployed in Kubernetes.

### 22.7.2. Database

- To maintain static and configurable data, a relational database will be used and will be deployed in Kubernetes.
- To manage the online transactional data, a NoSQL database will be used, deployed over bare metal servers outside the Kubernetes Cluster. Configuration will be done to achieve optimum communication between this database and the application deployed over the Kubernetes cluster.

## 22.7. Event Broker Platform

The Event Broker platform is required for the following functional requirements:

- **Main transaction flow**
- Saga pattern (Orchestration and Choreography)
- Chained request-response mechanism:
- Controller microservice will initiate the booking transaction and post the transaction data in the event broker topic. Desired service will consume, process, and post the data in the desired topic.
- Next service will consume from the topic and process. This flow will execute subsequently until the end of the transaction, with the final response being consumed by the Controller micro-service.
- To implement CQRS by updating the read query database through separate micro-services.
- Charting - Read multiple records from DB and send to the charting application through the event Broker platform.
- Data Change History / Journaling - for post facto analysis.
- Add-on services - like:
- SMS
- Mail
- Catering, etc.
